# User Session Length prediction in streaming media

We uset the last.fm 1K dataset and try to predict the user session length using ML, Deep Learning and Panel data techniques and compare them with the state of the art models published in :
- Audio Ad Quality Prediction ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03319.pdf)
- Predicting Session Length in Media Streaming ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00130.pdf, and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01440.pdf)

The feature engineering has been done with 
  pyspark - Deep Learning models
  Postgres - R Panel data models
  Postgres + pyspark - ML models
