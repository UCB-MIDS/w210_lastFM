## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

train_data <- na.omit(read.csv(file="usersessions-with-char-sec-train.csv", header=TRUE, row.names = NULL, sep="|"))

panel.data.train <- plm.data(train_data, index = c("session_start","userid"))

mdl_fe <-plm(session_length~age+session_length_mvavg,  data = panel.data.train, model = "within")

##Summaries

summary(mdl_fe)

#cat(length(panel.data.train$session_length), length(mdl_fd$residuals))
# Fitted vs Observed and Fitted vs Residuals plots
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(panel.data.train$session_length-mdl_fe$residuals, panel.data.train$session_length, asp=1, ylab = "Observed", xlab = "Fitted", main = "Fitted vs Observed ")
abline(0,1, col='red', lty='dashed', lwd=2)

## Fitted vs Residuals plots
plot(panel.data.train$session_length-mdl_fe$residuals,mdl_fe$residuals, asp=1, ylab = "Observed", xlab = "Fitted", main = "Fitted vs Residuals")
abline(0,0, col='red', lty='dashed', lwd=2)

## MAE and RMSE

mae_fe = mean(abs(mdl_fe$residuals))
rmse_fe = sqrt(mean(abs(mdl_fe$residuals)^2))

cat('MAE = ', mae_fe, ', RMSE = ', rmse_fe)
```
